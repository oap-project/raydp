# Running RayDP on k8s cluster

## Build docker image
Building docker image with the following command, and this will create an image tag with `oap-project/raydp:latest`
```shell
# under ${RAYDP_HOME}/docker
./build-docker.sh
```
Then you can push the built image to repository or spread to the k8s worker nodes.

## Build the master branch image
Our master branch code can be installed with `pip install raydp-nightly`, so you just need to modify the following code in `Dockfile` to try the master branch code.
```shell
RUN sudo http_proxy=${HTTP_PROXY} https_proxy=${HTTPS_PROXY} apt-get update -y \
    && sudo http_proxy=${HTTP_PROXY} https_proxy=${HTTPS_PROXY} apt-get install -y openjdk-8-jdk \
    && sudo mkdir /raydp \
    && sudo chown -R ray /raydp \
    && $HOME/anaconda3/bin/pip --no-cache-dir install raydp-nightly
```

## Start up Ray cluster
```shell
ray up ${RAYDP_HOME}/docker/example.yaml
```
The above command will print the steps that you can attach or submit job to the cluster.
## Connect to the Ray cluster
```shell
ray attach ${RAYDP_HOME}/docker/example.yaml
```
After you attached to the head node, you can program as normally. The following is an example.
```python
import ray
import raydp

# connect to the cluster
ray.init(address='auto', _redis_password='the password printed when you start up the cluster')

# init spark
spark = raydp.init_spark("K8S test", num_executors=2, executor_cores=1, executor_memory="512M")
spark.range(0, 100).count()
```

## Destroy the Ray cluster
```
ray down ${RAYDP_HOME}/docker/example.yaml
```
